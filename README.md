# 🌍 Kilometers & Kilometers – Cultural Tourism Platform

Kerala’s heritage is not static—it lives in the **songs of Theyyam**, the **scent of Aranmula mirrors**, the **looms of Balaramapuram**, and the **stories whispered in tea shops**. Yet, many of these treasures remain hidden unless actively woven into modern life.  

This project is a **tech-enabled cultural tourism platform** that brings Kerala’s living heritage closer to people through technology, storytelling, and accessibility.

## 📖 Project Description
Our platform aims to:  
- 🗺️ **Map and curate hyperlocal heritage experiences** – folklore, artisans, cultural spots, and events.  
- 🚌 **Integrate with KSRTC routes** – suggesting cultural tourism paths tied to festivals, rituals, and markets.  
- 🛍️ **Promote local cottage industries** – with verified vendor partnerships and micro e-commerce listings.  

By combining **AI, crowd input, and tourism APIs**, the system generates **personalized cultural trails**, enabling users to discover, book, and support Kerala’s heritage experiences.  

Think of it as:  
- **Google Maps for cultural storytelling**,  
- fused with **Shopify for artisans**,  
- and **KSRTC for mobility**.
